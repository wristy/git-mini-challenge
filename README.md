# Mini-challenge: Git

1. This mini-challenge should serve as a practical Git exercise.
2. Fork this repo by clicking on "Fork" button between the "Unwatch" and "Star" buttons.
3. In the forked repo, create a branch from `main` with the name `story_edit_by_{your name}`
4. Clone this repo onto your device (make the repo available locally) - you can achieve that via a git command. Google how to do that via the terminal.
5. Go into the folder by typing `“cd git-mini-challenge”` via terminal. This repo contains a `.txt` file describing a fictional story.
6. TODO:
   1. Edit the story in the `words.txt` file, change the club name to ‘Apps Club’ and change the app name to ‘Health First’. Go to the last sentence and add two more sentences to that.
   2. In the terminal, using what you learned, stage your changes, log/commit your changes locally then push it to the remote repo.
   3. Finally, go to Github and make a pull request that merges the `story_edit_by_{your name}` branch into the `main` branch.
